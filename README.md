# Operating-System-AUTOMATION üë©‚Äçüíª
An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware.  Designed a project to automate daily tasks on our operating system which results reducing time consumption.
 It performs basic tasks such as file, memory and process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.Some popular Operating Systems include Linux Operating System, Windows Operating System, VMS, Mac operating system, OS/400, etc. 
 
 How we are goin to automate Opearting System?
 Automating opearing system will be beneficial for both students & teachers. Here I've used libraries of Javascript and node modules to build this code. 
 JavaScript has library NodeJs and in NodeJS there is robot.Js module which we used for automating mouse, keyboard, screen, etc.
 
 In Mac Os we have command line, In windows we have command prompt, In Linux we have terminal. We simply need to type the code initials on cmd and you're hands will be folded & system will automate itself.
 It can open different websites for you, desktop applications and what not. You just need to code accordingly.
 I've custamized this as per my needs, go commit and get your version of this!
